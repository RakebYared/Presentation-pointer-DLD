## 🔧 Features

- **Timer Functionality:** Built-in timer for presentation time tracking.
- **Buzzer System:** Alerts the presenter at specified intervals.
- **Pointer Logic:** Core control logic simulating a standard presentation pointer.
- **Modular Design:** Includes subsystems like comparators, latches, and counters.
